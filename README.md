# Three-Tiered-Web-Based_App
A university project that allowed for a user to interact with a JavaServer Page (JSP) through a web browser. This JSP could either simply print the results of SELECT queries by rewriting the index.html file and refreshing the page or it could send the users inputs to a Java servlet. The Java servlet would then apply application logic to their inputs before finally recording the outputs to a MySQL database.
